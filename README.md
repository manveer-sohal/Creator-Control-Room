# Creator-Control-Room
a Creator Control Room which provides a dashboard for agencies/teams (“tenants”) to monitor their creators’ Twitch status (live/offline, follows, subs, cheers, raids), Discord community events (joins/messages), and StreamElements tips, all in real time. Twitch &amp; StreamElements use WebSockets; Discord uses the Gateway WS.
